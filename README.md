How to write and maintain structured policy and procedure documents using DITA XML
==================================================================================

by John Tait

This is a draft book about using DITA XML to create procedure and policy documents, rather than creating product documentation or software user guides. It's intended for authors and decision-makers faced with (or considering) using DITA for both new documents and migrating legacy content.

The book source is itself DITA. It's currently being written, but please create a working copy for yourself at any point in its development. The DITA source will remain online after publication.

Files
-----

I'm using the file extension .xml rather than .dita for the topic files to enable Github to present the files in a more readable way. I might switch in the future.
