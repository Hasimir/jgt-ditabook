How to write and maintain structured policy and procedure standards documents using DITA XML (the easy way)
===========================================================================================================

by John Tait

This is a _draft_ book about using DITA XML to create procedure and policy documents. DITA is usually used to create product documentation or software user guides. This book is for you if you write standards of any kind. It's intended for authors and decision-makers faced with (or considering) using DITA for both new documents and migrating legacy content.

It doesn't deal with the technical aspects so much because this information is widely available elsewhere. This book mainly discusses the unique aspects for writing standards.

The book source is itself DITA. Please create a working copy for yourself at any point in its development. The DITA source will remain online after publication.

Files
-----

I'm using the file extension .xml rather than .dita for the topic files to enable Github to present the files in a more readable way. I might switch in the future.
