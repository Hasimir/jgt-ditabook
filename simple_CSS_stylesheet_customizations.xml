    <title>Appendix: Simple CSS stylesheet customisations for standards</title>
    <shortdesc>Updating the CSS stylesheet is the simplest way to customize your output. You can add
        an additional stylesheet rather than modify the standard DITA-OT one.</shortdesc>

            <title>Emphasising the Short Description</title>
            <p>It's often worth emphasising the Short Description if you are using it as a STOP
                thesis sentence. Add something like this to your custom CSS:</p>
            <codeblock>p.shortdesc { font-weight: bold; color: blue; }</codeblock>
            <p>This will emphasise the text in the topic itself. It will appear as plain text as
                usual under titles on nested topics.</p>

        <p>Numbering can be added to EPUB and other XHTML-based out by adding the following to
            the CSS.
            <codeblock>body { counter-reset: H1; } 	/* Create the counter for H1 */
h1:before {
  content: counter(H1) ". "; 	/* Print the H1 number */
  counter-increment: H1; 	/* Add 1 to next H1 */
}
h1 { counter-reset: H2; }
h2:before {
  content: counter(H1) "." counter(H2) " ";
  counter-increment: H2;
}
h2 { counter-reset: H3; }
h3:before {
  content: counter(H1) "." counter(H2) "." counter(H3) " ";
  counter-increment:H3;
}</codeblock></p>
