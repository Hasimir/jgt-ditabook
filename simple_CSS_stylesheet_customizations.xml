    <title>Appendix: Simple CSS stylesheet customisations for standards</title>
    <shortdesc>Updating the CSS stylesheet is the simplest way to customize your output. You can add
        an additional stylesheet rather than modify the standard DITA-OT one.</shortdesc>

            <title>Emphasising the short description</title>
            <p>It's often worth emphasising the short description, especially if you are using it as
                a STOP thesis sentence. Add something like this to your custom CSS:</p>
            <codeblock>p.shortdesc { font-weight: bold; color: blue; }</codeblock>
            <p>This will emphasise the text in the topic itself. It will appear as plain text as
                usual under titles on nested topics.</p>

            <title>Using the Outputclass attribute for additional styling</title>
            <p>Highlighting text in EPUB and other XHTML-based output can be done with the
                    <codeph>outputclass</codeph> attribute. This is useful for, say, the styling
                text flagged with the <codeph>importance</codeph> attribute, which isn't currently
                styled by the DITA Open Toolkit.</p>
            <p>Even though it makes no difference to the rendering, I have used the importance
                attribute <i>as well</i> as the <codeph>outputclass</codeph> attribute to give it
                some semantic meaning.</p>
            
<codeblock>
&lt;p outputclass="highlight" importance="required">This requirement will be styled by your CSS.&lt;/p>
</codeblock>
            <p>Here is the CSS:</p>

            <codeblock>.highlight { font-weight: bold ; color: red; }</codeblock>

        <section>
            <title>Adding numberings to clause and subclause headings</title>
        <p>Numbering can be added to EPUB and other XHTML-based output by adding the following to
                the CSS.
                <codeblock>body { counter-reset: H1; } 	/* Create the counter for H1 */
h1:before {
  content: counter(H1) ". "; 	/* Print the H1 number */
  counter-increment: H1; 	/* Add 1 to next H1 */
}
h1 { counter-reset: H2; }
h2:before {
  content: counter(H1) "." counter(H2) " ";
  counter-increment: H2;
}
h2 { counter-reset: H3; }
h3:before {
  content: counter(H1) "." counter(H2) "." counter(H3) " ";
  counter-increment:H3;
}</codeblock></p>
