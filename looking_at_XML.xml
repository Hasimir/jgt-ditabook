    <title>Looking at XML for technical authors</title>
    <shortdesc>XML has its roots as a document markup language. Nevertheless, it's ugly and you'll
        need an XML editor to ease your eyes from the angle brackets and to avoid typing closing
        tags elements.</shortdesc>

            <title>oXygen is a deservedly popular XML editor</title>
            <p>It comes recommended by Elior Kimber/</p>
            <p>Using an XML editor like oXygen can be unsettling for a technical author. There are
                many open windows displaying lots of technical options.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, I would resist using a <i>Word</i>-based tool or any other tools that
                purportedly makes the author's life easier.</p>
            <p>At times, it's simpler to drop into the raw XML when the editor doesn't behave as
                expected, or it's just simpler. For example, editing file extensions in DITA maps is
                much easier using the Text view rather than the Author view</p>
