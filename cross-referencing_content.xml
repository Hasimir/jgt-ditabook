    <shortdesc>Most policy and procedure documents are extensively numbered. This provides for
        simple cross-referencing, but creates a massive overhead for maintainability of the whole
        document and, particularly, reuse of the smaller parts in other related documents. Without
        numbering, or where final numbering isn't going to be available to you as an author, focus
        on the names of elements you will refer to and reference those.</shortdesc>
