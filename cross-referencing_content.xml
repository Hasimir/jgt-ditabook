    <title>Cross-referencing content, knowledge management implications of managing section numbering and other kinds of
        sequential numbering</title>
    <shortdesc>Most policy and procedure documents are extensively numbered. This provides for
        simple cross-referencing, but creates a massive overhead for maintainability of the whole
        document and, particuarly, reuse of the smaller parts in other related. Without numbering, or where final numbering isn't going to be available to you as an
        author, focus on the names of elements you will refer to a reference those.</shortdesc>

            <p>There is an obvious cost in ease of reference for particular sections. This might
                cause some difficulty with claiming compliance with particular sections.</p>
            <p>There seems to be no real reason whyDITA processing tools could provide optional
                numbering on the output, but this doesn't seem to be a priority.</p>
