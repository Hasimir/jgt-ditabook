            <p> Download the DITA source from <xref href="https://github.com/johngtait/ditabook"
                    format="html"/>. Please use the source in any of your own learning materials and
                improve it as you need to.</p>
            <p>I hesitate to say "study it", because this book isn't designed as an exemplar of good
                DITA coding style. Instead, use the source to learn the basics or to provide basics
                to others.</p>
