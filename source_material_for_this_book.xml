            <p>Download the DITA source from <xref href="https://github.com/johngtait/ditabook"
                    format="html"/>. You're free to use the source in any of your own materials and
                change it if you need to. This DITA code isn't designed as an exemplar of good DITA
                coding style, but you could also use it to learn the basics or to provide some
                examples of the basics to others.</p>
