    <title>Rendering output to PDF, EPUB, XHTML and WebHelp</title>
    <shortdesc>oXygen Author comes with the open source DITA Open Toolkit (DITA-OT). The DITA-OT
        (with the DITAforPublishers plug in) can render to common formats out of the box. EPUB files
        are suitable for ereaders, and web-based output is suitable for browsers.</shortdesc>

            <title>How to render different output formats</title>
            <p>To generate the output, make sure you have displayed the top level map in the Author
                view. If you are viewing a topic rather than a map, you'll just render the topic
                with a choice of only PDF or XHTML (plus other projects that you've made
                yourself).</p>
            <p>As well as writing in mark up (where the effects of the mark up might not be very
                apparent), you will also have little direct control of the appearance of the output.
                This includes important aspects line page breaks and the appearance of tables.</p>
            <p>It can be difficult to adjust to this, particularly when you are used to having easy
                control of document presentation with a word processor, and especially when the
                output is less satisfactory than you can achieve with one.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, after time, it does become much simpler to just open a map and start
                work without being bothered by page layout, margins, and font size.</p>
            <p>Renderings (HTML, PDF, etc.) are necessarily static, but that is what is expected with
                published standards: they are relied on to have stable content and simple versioning
                and publication dates. </p>

            <title>XHTML output</title>
            <p>The DITA-OT generates ordinary XHTML hypertext. DITA is a reasonably straightforward
                technique to produce vanilla hypertext.</p>
            <p>It is suitable for passing onto professional web developers for further processing
                and professional styling.</p>
            <p>You can have some direct control of the appearance of XHTML output (and by extension
                EPUB and oXygen's WebHelp) by configuring the appearance using cascading style
                sheets (CSS). CSS provides a template-like way of altering the appearance. It's
                fairly easy to learn the basics of CSS (the web is not short of CSS tutorials) and
                it's well integrated with DITA and oXygen.</p>

        <section>
            <title>oXygen's WebHelp output</title>
            <p>An additional rendering provided by oXygen is its own "WebHelp" rendering. oXygen's WebHelp is possibly the easiest and simplest way to
                build a maintainable process and policy web-site.</p>
            <p>This gives a contents list, a word search (which also picks up keywords you add in
                topic metadata) and, if you add index entries to the metadata, an index. These three
                cover most kinds of search very well. (Only some kind of faceted browsing is
                missing.) It is a low cost way of building quite sophisticated web-sites out of the
                box.</p>
            <p>The main problem with WebHelp is that is clearly comes from the computer help
                tradition. This means that it will have the unfortunate flavour of other WebHelp. It
                usually has a disagreeably, choppy feel and is clearly constructed from small
                parts.</p>

            <title>oXygen's mobile WebHelp output</title>
            <p>Starting from version 15, oXygen has a mobile WebHelp rendering that is optimised for touchscreen devices (iPads, etc.)</p>

            <title>PDF output</title>
            <p>PDF output is quite poor. Looking at the rendering for the first time, it doesn't
                seem so bad but problems start if you want to improve it. PDF output is much, much
                harder to customise than XHTML. You can add some images to flag up parts of text in
                conditional processing, but that's about it for the DITA-OT unless you are or can
                call upon the skills of a developer.</p>
            <p>Changing font size, putting text in the header, and putting a logo on the front page
                are all very difficult. No index is generated using the DITA-OT. </p>
            <p>It seems likely that the DITA-OT's PDF rendering will improve in the future and, if
                you will stick with DITA over a long time period, you'll be better served.</p>
            <p>An alternative approach is to render a map as XHTML (chunked to a single document
                rather than render it as individual topics) and then convert the page to PDF. </p>

        <section>
            <title>EPUB output and ereaders</title>
            <p>You can picture EPUB files as little bundles of XHTML code that can be read like a
                book. You can read them with Adobe's Digital Editions, Firefox's EPUBreader add-on,
                tablets computers and ereaders.</p>
            <p>Ereaders are a bit slow, but they're light, portable and can be read mostly anywhere.
                They might be a good choice for staff working outdoors. You'll need one with EPUB
                support if you want to use oXygen's ebook output out-of-the-box.</p>
            <p>When your output is primarily going to be EPUB files, avoid using the
                    <codeph>collection-type=sequence</codeph> attribute, as that will create
                annoying <systemoutput>Previous topic</systemoutput> and <systemoutput>Next
                    topic</systemoutput> links, which don't work well in linearly-presented material
                like an ebook.</p>

            <title>Alternatives to the DITA Open Toolkit</title>
            <p>There are commercial solutions to the DITA Open Toolkit. These can be integrated with
                a component content management system.</p>
