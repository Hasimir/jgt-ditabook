    <title>Rendering output to PDF, EPUB, XHTML and oXygen's WebHelp</title>
    <shortdesc>OXygen Author comes with the open source DITA Open Toolkit (DITA-OT). The DITA-OT
        (with the DITAforPublishers plug in) can render to common formats out of the box. At the
        time of writing, the PDF output is underwhelming. EPUB files are suitable for ereaders, and
        web-based output are suitable for browsers.</shortdesc>

            <title>How to render different output formats</title>
            <p>To generate the output, make sure you have displayed the top elvle map in the Author
                view. If you are viewing a topic rather than a map, you'll just render the topic
                with a choice of only PDF or XHTML (plus other projects that you've made
                yourself).</p>
            <p>As well as writing in mark up (where the effects of the mark up might not be very
                apparent), you will also have little direct control of the appearance of the output.
                This includes important aspects line page breaks and the appearance of tables.It can
                be difficult to adjust to this, particulary when you are used to having easy control
                of document presentation with a word processor, and especially when the output is
                less satisfactory than you can acheive with one.Nevertheless, after time, it does
                become much simpler to just open a map and start work without being bothered by page
                layout, margins, and font size....advantages cond porf and transIn DITA, there is
                still some presentational structure to consider. Italics and bold are there, and
                images need to be given a (e.g width) size for PDF output (or they can spill over
                the page). It's still much, much less than you will find with a word processor.</p>

        <section>
            <title>PDF output</title>
            <p>PDF output is quite poor, and is somewhat controversial. Lookng at the rendering for
                the first time, it doesn't seem so bad. Problems start if you want to improve it.
                Nevertheless, It's easy to emphasise how you or your writers will spend less time
                worrying about structure and more time worrying about appearance. In fact, DITA
                users are very interested in the appearance of their documents.You can have some
                direct control of the appearance of XHTML output (and by extention EPUB and oXygen's
                WebHelp by configuring the appearance with cascading style sheets (CSS). CSS
                provides a template-like way of altering the appearance. It's fairly easy to learn
                the basics (the web is not short of CSS tutorials) and it's well integrated woth
                DITA and oXygen.PDF output is much, much harder to customise. You can add some
                images to flag up parts of text in conditional processing, but that's about it for
                the DITA-OT unless you are or can call upon the skills of a developer.</p>
            <p>Tables are particularly poor.</p>
            <p>Changing font size, putting text in the header, and putting a logo on the front page
                are all very difficult, and will need involvement.</p>
            <p>Also, currently, no index is generated.</p>
            <p>It seems likely that the DITA-OT's PDF rendering will improve in the future and, if
                you will stick with DITA over a long time period, you'll be better served. On the
                other hand, companies offering propriatory PDF rendering produce output that is
                somewhat similar.</p>
            <p>To be honest, if you need PDFoutput and you doesn't have a team of developers working
                for you, I'd probably not use DITA at all.</p>

        <section>
            <title>EPUB output and ereaders</title>
            <p>You can picture EPUB files as little bundles of html code that can be read like a
                book.</p>
            <p>You can read them with Adobe's Digital Editions, Firefox's EPUBreader add-on, tablets
                computers and ereaders.</p>
            <p>Currently, <keyword>ereaders</keyword> are pretty primitive. At the time of writting,
                a new generation with a built-in lights has been introduced. They are really quite
                nice.The display refresh is still a bit slow, but they're light, portable and can be
                read mostly anywhere. They might be a good choice for staff working outdoors. You'll
                need one with EPUB support if you want to use oXygen's ebook output
                out-of-the-box.</p>
            <p>When generating EPUB files, avoid using the <codeph>collection-type=sequence</codeph>
                attribute, as that will create highly annoying <systemoutput>Previous
                    topic</systemoutput> and <systemoutput>Next topic</systemoutput> links, which
                are horrible in linarly-presented material like an ebook. You'll lose the nice
                numbering of any nested topics, unfortunately.</p>

            <title>XHTML output</title>
            <p>The DITA-OT generates ordinary XHTML hypertext. DITA is a reasonably straightforward
                technique to produce vanilla hypertext.</p>
            <p>It is suitable for passing onto professional web developers for further processing
                and professional styling.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>oXygen's WebHelp output</title>
            <p><indexterm>WebHelp</indexterm>An additonal rendering provided by oXygen is its own
                "WebHelp" rendering.</p>
            <p>This gives a contents list, a word search (which also picks up keywords you add in
                topic metadata) and, if you add index entries to the metadata, an index. These three
                cover most kinds of search very well. (Only some kind of faceted browsing is
                missing.)</p>
            <p>It's also improved a lot of the last couple of years, with the addition of an index
                (improved over v14.0 to 14.1). The appearance of the WebHelp has changed over the
                years, showing it's under active development.</p>
            <p>"WebHelp" suggests shows Syncro Soft are competing against Flare, RoboHelp and the
                likes, and it brings DITA back to computer application help. However, what is
                actually provided is a very useful, low cost way of building quite sophisticated
                web-sites out of the box.</p>
            <p>I'd consider investigating this if your content will be based online only. Okay, they
                    <i>do</i> put a "WebHelp output generated by oXygen" message on every page, but
                you could always edit the html to get rid of it. I'd just leave it.</p>
            <p>The main problem with WebHelp is that is clearly comes from the computer help
                tradition. This means that it will have the unfortunate flavour of other
                WebHelp.</p>
            <p>WebHelp is the kind of computer help that you find when you press F1 on otherwise
                access webhelp on a computer application. It usually has a disagreeably, choppy
                feel. Help that connects to a well-written, up-to-date web-site is usually much
                better.</p>
            <p>Even WebHelp displayed using the Suite Soft HTML5 plug-in (link) still looks like
                DITA content. There are lots of small, disconnected topics, and the results feel
                much like other minimalist, ultra-topicised content.</p>
            <p>It can actually be quite satisfying to generate WebHelp with complex structure for
                the first time by nesting a complex arramgement of topics. Few readers really want
                to read information like that though, and you might just be building an unusable toy
                if you do.</p>
            <p>OXygen's WebHelp is probably the easiest and simplest way to build a maintainable
                process and policy web-site. Be aware of WebHelp's origin, and you should be
                okay.</p>
