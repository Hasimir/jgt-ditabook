            <p>The specialised topic for profiling will need to be maintained if you update your
                version of oXygen (always a good idea, since the features and the webhelp options
                are continually improving. Although specialising the topic type is a strightforward,
                mechanical expersice, it's still unplreasant and will involve testing. It;s just
                uncesseccary work to specialisetopicsthat you won;t use, and neater and safer not
                too.</p>
