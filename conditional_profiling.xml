    <title>Conditional profiling</title>
    <shortdesc>DITA allows conditional profiling. It's possible to use conditional profiling "out of
        the box" using the computer documentation defaults. Any more advanced profiling will require
        specialization of the DITA Open Toolkit.</shortdesc>

            <title>The default come from the computer documentation tradition</title>
            <p>In order to conditionally-filter content using your own profiling attributes, you're
                going to have to specialise the DITA open toolkit. This means edit a few lines in a
                text file, and create a new text file as well. It's not pleasant, but it's useful
                because you can them filter out content to suit. This can minimise the number of
                actual files you need to maintain.</p>

            <title>Use the DITA Map Manager</title>
            <p>To enable integration with Subject Scheme maps (and other features like "Search
                References" for conrefs, keep your top level map open in DITA Maps Manager. (Open
                the window is <menucascade>
                    <uicontrol>Window</uicontrol>
                    <uicontrol>Show View</uicontrol>
                    <uicontrol>DITA Maps Manager</uicontrol>
                </menucascade>. (You'll need to do this even if you've opened up the top level map
                in Author mode.</p>
