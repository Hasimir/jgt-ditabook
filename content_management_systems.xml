    <title>Content management</title>
    <shortdesc>Content management systems are probably required for mature, large, established
        projects. However, due to the medium-term lifespan of policy and procedure documents,
        consider carefully if one is really needed. For new authors, modular writing, XML, DITA, and
        XML editors such as oXygen already provide a significant learning curve.</shortdesc>
