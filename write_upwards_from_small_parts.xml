    <title>Write upwards from small parts rather than divide a large document down into small
        parts</title>
    <shortdesc>Writing using DITA allows you to construct your document from smaller parts that you
        can assemble usiing a map. Although it requires a bit more forethrought, it will make tha
        document much easier to maintain and allow the smaller parts to be reused in related
        documents.</shortdesc>

            <title>The end results look similar but they are not</title>
            <p>A document written from the bottom up can <i>look</i> similar to a document split
                into sections and subsections ("clauses" and "subclauses" in standards), but they
                are quite different regarding their maintainabilty and (less visibly but not less
                true), sometimes their ability to be understood by their reader.</p>
