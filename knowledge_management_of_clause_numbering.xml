    <title>Knowledge management implications of managing section numbering and other kinds of
        sequential numbering</title>
    <shortdesc>Most policy and procedure documents are extensively numbered. This provides for
        simple cross-referencing, but creates a massive overhead for maintainability of the whole
        document and, particuarly, reuse of the smaller parts in other related.</shortdesc>

            <p>There is an obvious cost in ease of reference for particular sections. This might
                cause some difficulty with claiming compliance with particular sections.</p>
            <p>There seems to be no real reason whyDITA processing tools could provide optional
                numbering on the output, but this doesn't seem to be a priority.</p>
