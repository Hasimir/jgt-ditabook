            <title>Send out a comments form to allow compilation of comments and prevent annotated
                drafts</title>
            <p>Reviewers (sometimes called stakeholders) can't really be expected to understand DITA
                code or work within a content management system. The <i>ad hoc</i> nature of
                standards, which means that new writers are always involved,  is amplified when
                stakeholders are involved. New stakeholders will probably be uninterested.</p>
            <p>Possibly the simplest way to review a standard is to circulate a draft PDF with an
                editable comments form. Comments forms can be easily collated (with comments
                arranged by clause number, etc.) to allow them to be reviewed in sequence.</p>
            <p>This isn't any different from the conventional way of drafting standards, i.e. the
                underlying DITA code ought to be invisible to the reader.</p>
            <p>If the authors and stakeholders are drawn from the same small team, it might be
                possible to get a technological solution working instead, but in practice it'd
                better to drop the barrier to entry for the stakeholders to get as many
                contributions as possible.</p>
