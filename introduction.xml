  <p>This is really written for someone writting or managing policy and procedure documents, and
   standards documents of any kind. These are usually maanged by dedicated teams, but the content
   comes from experts in their fields, who usually don't care to much about documenatation because
   their expertise lies in other areas.</p>
  <p>Can the technology and technique called DITA help? Well, perhaps.</p>
  <p>There are some very real advantages to trying DITA, and some real problems. If you are involved
   in managing standards, I think it could be well worth trying, but the existing literature seems
   to be written by<ul id="ul_tdm_4xr_h3">
    <li>originators and implemetators of the specification, who are probably too close to it and are
     perhaps not aware of the specific needs of standards authors</li>
    <li>consultants of various kinds, who might emphasise some of the benefits and less of the
     disadvantages, and who also try to solve unnecessary technical problems</li>
    <li>technical writers in the specific fields of product documentation and, more especially
     computer software documentation, which is quite a different genre from standards, and focussed
     on irrelvant and (controversially) unhelpful techniques.</li>
   </ul></p>
  <p>This short book was written in DITA. It was easy to write, but I'm not ware of its limitations
   too. Let's explore how it might, or might not help.</p>
