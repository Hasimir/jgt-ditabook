    <title>Advantages of using DITA for policy and procedure documents</title>
    <shortdesc>Many companies have a vast number of documents, many of which have significantly
        overlapping concepts. Efforts to write a policy or procedure the traditional way can be
        thwarted by questions like “where does this information really belong?” It’s a question that
        just goes away when you can reassemble a document using a disposable map, then assemble
        another manual later using some of the same bits.</shortdesc>

        <section><p>Most reference works to DITA have a slant towards localisation and translation
                costs. Localisation and translation isn’t usually of interest when writing policy
                and procedure documents. Other DITA refernce works expects the content to be in the
                genre of product information, where DITA’s core support seems to reside
             </p>Specific systems can fundamentally cut across disciplines (track, signals, etc.) It
            would be a simple (very big, but simple) exercise to cut the material up and reassemble
            it cleanly into manuals using DITA.<p>Efforts to write a manual the traditional way can
                be thwarted by questions like “where does this information really belong?” It’s a
                question that just goes away when you can reassemble a document using a disposable
                map, then assemble another manual later using some of the same bits.</p><p>I
                personally suspect that there a vast underworld of unmaintained policy and procedure
                documents in lots of big companies and government organisations that I know DITA
                could make a real difference with. </p></section>
