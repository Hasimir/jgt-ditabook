    <title>Advantages of using DITA for policy and procedure documents</title>
    <shortdesc>Many companies have a vast number of their documents, many of which have
        significantly overlapping concepts. Efforts to write a policy or procedure the traditional
        way can be thwarted by questions like “where does this information really belong?” It’s a
        question that just goes away when you can reassemble a document using a disposable map, then
        assemble another manual later using some of the same bits.</shortdesc>

            <p>Localisation and translation isn’t at all of interest in engineering, nor really is
                the whole genre of product information, which is where DITA’s core support seems to
                reside  </p>
            <p>Many companies have a vast number of their documents, many of which have
                significantly overlapping concepts.</p>
            <p>Specific systems can fundamentally cut across disciplines (track, signals, etc.) It
                would be a simple (very big, but simple) exercise to cut the material up and
                reassemble it cleanly into manuals using DITA.</p>
            <p>Efforts to write a manual the traditional way can be thwarted by questions like
                “where does this information really belong?” It’s a question that just goes away
                when you can reassemble a document using a disposable map, then assemble another
                manual later using some of the same bits.</p>
            <p>I personally suspect that there a vast underworld of unmaintained policy and
                procedure documents in lots of big companies and government organisations that I
                know DITA could make a real difference with. </p>
