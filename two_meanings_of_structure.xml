    <title>Two meanings of "structure"</title>
    <shortdesc>Structure can mean the assembly of documents from small building blocks called
        "topics", and also a consistent internal structure using a text mark-up
        language.</shortdesc>

            <title>Mark up separates meaning from presentation</title>
            <p>It can be difficult to adjust to this, particulary when you are used to having easy
                control of document presentatin with a word processor, and especially when the
                output is <i>less</i> satisfactory than you can acheive with one.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, after time, it does become much simpler to just open a file and start
                work without being bothered by page layout, margins, and font size.</p>
            <p>In DITA, there is still some presentational structure to consider. Italics and bold
                are there, and images need to be given a (e.g <codeph>width</codeph>) size for PDF
                output (or they can spill over the page). It's still much, much less than you will
                find with a word processor.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, It's easy to emphasise how you or your writers will spend less time
                worrying about structre and more time worrying about appearance. In fact, DITA users
                are very interested in the appreance of their documents. You'll need to learn CSS,
                or [deal with XSL for PDF output].</p>
            <p>Large Word documents are unwieldly, inconsistent, and tend to die after 50 pages.</p>
            <p>A real problem with Word documents is that they just don't scale. There's many way to
                acheive the same thing.</p>
