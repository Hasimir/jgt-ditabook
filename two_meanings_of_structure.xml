    <title>Two meanings of "structure"</title>
    <shortdesc>Structure can mean the assembly of documents from small building blocks called
        "topics", and also a consistent internal structure using a text mark-up
        language.</shortdesc>

            <title>Mark up separares meaning from presentation</title>
            <p>It can be difficult to adject to this, particulary when you are used to having easy
                control of document presentatin with a word proessor, and especially when the output
                is <i>less</i> satidfactory than you can acheive with one.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, after time, it does become much simper to just open a file and start
                work without being botherede by page layout, margins, and font size.</p>
            <p>In DITA, there is still some structure to consider. Italics and bold are there. (LaTe
                uses markup "emph" for emphasis, which is more ideally presentation free) and images
                need to be given a size for PDF output, or they spill overthe page. It's still much,
                much less than you will find with a word processor.</p>
